						<div class="about__text">
							<p>
								I've always had a deep fascination with
								<span class="highlight">technolog</span>y and a passion for
								<span class="highlight">gaming</span> from a young age. However,
								as I grew older and entered the workforce, my time for these
								interests began to <span class="highlight">dwindle</span>. Then,
								during the <span class="highlight">COVID lockdown</span>, I
								stumbled upon the world of programming and was captivated by
								content creators on YouTube who were building incredible
								projects from the comfort of their own little PC setups. I had
								always believed that do such things required large offices and
								teams, but witnessing what these creators were achieving ignited
								my curiosity.<br /><br />

								Motivated by the contents I saw, I started learning Python
								through online tutorials. This newfound journey brought me
								immense joy as I was finally able to pursue my passion. I called
								upon my <span class="highlight">friends</span> to learn together
								with me, but
								<span class="highlight">none seem to be interested</span>. Yet,
								I continued...all alone. As we know, learning without the
								knowledge to create a structured plan proved to be a bit
								<span class="highlight">frustrating</span>, top if off with
								learning all by yourself. In short, even with efforts, my
								<span class="highlight">progress was slow</span>, and it felt
								<span class="highlight">demotivating</span>.<br /><br />

								On the other hand ,
								<span class="highlight">my time was limited</span>, and I
								neededed to acquire a valuable skill quickly before the covid
								lockdown was lifted. This prompted me to consider a shift in
								focus towards other fields like
								<span class="highlight">photography and videography</span>,
								things which I already have a good grasp on thanks to my keen
								interest in it since my teenage years. While coding was
								appealing because of its
								<span class="highlight"
									>immediate results and room for experimentation</span
								>
								which I appreciate, unfortunately, I had to explore other
								creative outlets for the time being. Nonetheless, my fascination
								with programming still lingers within me, and I occasionally
								revisit it once in a while. <br /><br />

								Last month, upon hearing about Sigma School's scholarship
								program for <span class="highlight">refugees</span>, I
								immediatly thought "Finally, I do not have to code alone", that
								is what I thought. <span class="highlight"></span>Wasting no
								time, I decided to seize this opportunity without hesitation. It
								feels like the right path to harness my potential and provide me
								with the skills and support (community) needed to pursue my
								passion in the world oftechnology and programming. <br />
